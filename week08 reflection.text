I still need a lot more practice with what this assignment mainly had to do. It was easier
since we had examples in class and explanation, but I can see myself struggling when trying to incorporate it 
by myself into a different unrelated method. What I noticed is that it's easy to get lost when there's so much code 
which is why segmentation is so important. My use of type hint sand comments keeps improving and becoming a lot easier to do.
My thought process has also become a lot better when it come sto coding as well.
